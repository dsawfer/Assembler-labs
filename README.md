### Lab2
Using a hotkey, the resident program displays a window in which the 'up arrow' and 'down arrow' keys are used to select the file operation mode, i.e. the type of files that cannot be deleted. In case of an attempt to delete a file with the selected extension, the program displays a message. Provide the possibility of unloading the program and protection against reloading.
